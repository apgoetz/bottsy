    <h1>About this Project</h1> 
    <p>This project is a joint effort by Andy Goetz (dixicup), Kevin
    Riedl (wookiee), and Camille Huffman (squidpie). Its purpose is to
    explore procedurally-generated art, directed by humans. Visitors
    clicks are used as a fitness function to drive the genetic
    algorithm that draws the art. </p>
    <p>
      This is a project for Dr. Perkowski's Fall 2012 Robotics class.
